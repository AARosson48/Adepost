# Adepost
The app Name is a play on the word Adipose. Like Adipose Tissue or Animal Fat.

## Description
Adepost is a localized peer-to-peer community app, built with .NET MAUI, designed to empower users by eliminating reliance on costly centralized hosting and storage. Inspired by the idea of sticking it to the "fat cats" of the tech industry, Adepost fosters a decentralized approach that ensures:
- No hosting costs: By leveraging peer-to-peer communication, users interact directly without a server.
- Complete privacy: With no centralized infrastructure, user data is never cached or stored.
- Freedom from regulatory hurdles: The absence of server-side infrastructure removes the need to comply with government regulations typically required for hosted services.

Think of Adepost as a digital version of a community noticeboard—simple, secure, and entirely user-driven.
## Features (Planned)
- Map-Based Interface: Users post and view community messages through an intuitive map, with cat-themed markers representing individual posts.
- Customizable Filters: State, city, and category filters allow users to define the exact area and topics they’re interested in.
- Dynamic Key Generation: Ensuring only users within the same location and timeframe can interact with posts for added privacy and localization.
- Zero Host Architecture: Bypasses traditional server-based models, relying solely on real-time, peer-to-peer communication.

## Open Source Vision
Adepost isn't just an app, it's also a backbone for developers looking to create peer-to-peer applications without the need for servers or centralized infrastructure.
- Build your own projects: Leverage Adepost's architecture to create decentralized solutions for communication, networking, and more.
- Collaborate: Contribute to the repository to enhance features and refine the underlying technology.
- Innovate: Extend the concept of zero-host applications in new and creative directions.

## More Info
This repository serves as the home of the Adepost idea, with plans to evolve it into a fully functional app. Contributions and collaborators are always welcome! The first commits will start rolling out once time allows for active development.
